# GitHub Actions workflow example of running Hackolade Studio CLI
For CI/CD scenarios leveraging the Docker image of Hackolade Studio CLI [documented here](https://github.com/hackolade/docker/tree/main/Studio#readme), it is useful to leverage the GitHub Action workflow.  This repository is just a simple example.  It should serve as an inspiration for users.  It is possible to orchestrate a succession of Hackolade Studio CLI commands, combined with Git commands and others to achieve ambitious use cases, all triggered by events in your repository.  For example when a PR for a model is merged in to the main branch.

## Licensing

> [!TIP]
>Running Hackolade Studio Docker image on GitHub Actions requires a concurrent License.
>To purchase a concurrent license subscription, please send an email to sales@hackolade.com.

This repository exposes a workflow example that uses a license that is managed as a [GitHub Action secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). License keys should be kept secret.

## Build your Docker image and push it to Docker Hub

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) contained in this repository allows to build an image with the lastest release available at the time of build for Hackolade Studio using [hackolade/studio](https://hub.docker.com/r/hackolade/studio/)

> [!TIP]
>In order to significantly save bandwidth, it is advised to build the image and push the image to Docker Hub or your own private Container registry of choice.

In the example we will suppose we have the image ***studio:latest*** hosted on Docker Hub with the plugins we want to use.

```bash
docker buildx build -t studio:latest --push .
```

> [!NOTE]
>Make sure your compose file is aligned.

## Generating documentation with a [Docker image built locally](./Dockerfile) and a [compose file](./compose.yml)

For the sake of demonstrating how to use Hackolade Studio CLI triggered by GitHub Actions, this repository contains [one workflow file](./.github/workflows/generate-doc-and-jsonschema.yml)
It uses an example Couchbase model ***travel.json*** contained in this repository.

> [!NOTE]
>This workflow example as a manual trigger (e.g. uses workflow_dispatch GHA trigger event).

The workflow file executes the following steps:

1. Validates a concurrent license key (managed as a repository secret) using necessary information
2. Generates Markdown documentation for the example travel.json model
4. Gathers logs and generated artifacts into Github workspace on the runner
5. Opens a Pull Request from these artifacts

The workflow and the compose files are aligned and use the following default variables:

- ***HACKOLADE_STUDIO_CLI_IMAGE*** defaulting to `studio:latest` -> the Docker image name for Hackolade Studio Cli.
- ***REPOSITORY_DIR_IN_CONTAINER*** defaulting to `/github/workspace/repository` -> the working directory for the cli and where the Github repository content is mounted.
- ***OUTPUT_DIR_IN_CONTAINER*** defaulting to `/home/hackolade/Documents/output` -> where artifacts are generated by the cli.

## Common scenario: Trigger the workflow when a Pull Request is merged in to the main branch.

>A data modeler pushes a Pull Request that updates a model using Hackolade Studio Workgroup Edition.

In this scenario, we would like to automatically generate the new Markdown documentation for this updated model when the Pull Request is being merged into the `main` branch

In such a case, your workflow trigger has to be like the following:

```yaml
name: Run Hackolade CLI using Docker Compose on Github Actions
on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main
jobs:
 run-hackolade-with-compose:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
        # License key must be managed as a secret (Repository or Organization)
        HACKOLADE_KEY: ${{ secrets.HACKOLADE_CONCURRENT_LICENSE_KEY }}
        HACKOLADE_STUDIO_CLI_IMAGE: studio:latest
        REPOSITORY_DIR_IN_CONTAINER: '/github/workspace/repository'
        OUTPUT_DIR_IN_CONTAINER: '/home/hackolade/Documents/output'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # OR "2" -> To retrieve the preceding commit.

      #https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files?tab=readme-ov-file#on-push-%EF%B8%8F
      - name: Get changed files
        id: changed-files
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@ed68ef82c095e0d48ec87eccea555d944a631a4c # v46
        files: '**/*.hck.json'

      # - ... validate license (check workflow example)

      - name: Generate MD documentation for all changed models
        env:
          ALL_CHANGED_FILES: ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}
        run: |
          for modelFile in ${ALL_CHANGED_FILES}; do
            modelFilenameWithoutExt=$(echo "${modelFile%.*}")
            docker compose run --rm hackoladeStudioCLI genDoc \
            --model=${modelFile} \
            --format=MD \
            --doc=${{ env.OUTPUT_DIR_IN_CONTAINER }}/${modelFilenameWithoutExt}.md
          done
        ...

```
